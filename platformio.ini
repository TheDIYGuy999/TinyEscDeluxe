; Note, that you need to run "Platformio, attiny85, Platform, Set Fuses" in order to set the fuses on new chips before uploading the code

board_fuses.hfuse = 0xD5
board_fuses.efuse = 0xFF

upload_protocol = stk500v1
; each flag in a new line
upload_flags =
    -P$UPLOAD_PORT
    -b$UPLOAD_SPEED

upload_speed = 19200
upload_port = /dev/cu.usbmodem1301 ; Set the port to the Arduino COM Port (you will need to change this to match your PC)
